# Registration Form with Validation

Welcome to the **Registration Form with Validation** project! This project provides a simple registration form that includes essential validation checks for email and password fields. It ensures that users provide the correct information and displays helpful error messages when needed.

## üìã Features

- **Email Validation**: Validates that the entered email follows a correct email format.
- **Password Matching**: Ensures that the password and the confirm password fields match.
- **Real-time Error Feedback**: Displays error messages when fields are missing or incorrect.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean, simple design to guide users through the registration process.

## üìÅ Files

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the form structure and embedded JavaScript logic for validation.
- **style2.css**: External CSS file used for styling the form (ensure this file is included in your project).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This registration form allows users to input their **email**, **password**, and **confirm password**. When the user clicks "Register", the form performs the following validations:
1. **Field Completeness**: Ensures no fields are left empty.
2. **Email Validation**: Checks that the email is in the correct format (e.g., `user@example.com`).
3. **Password Matching**: Verifies that the password and the confirmation password fields are identical.

If any validation fails, the user will see an error message, guiding them to correct their input. If the data is valid, the form is considered successfully submitted, and a confirmation message appears.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Clone or Download**: Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. **Link CSS**: Ensure the `style2.css` file is linked correctly to `index.html`.
3. **Open in Browser**: Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to use the registration form.
4. **Submit the Form**: Fill out the form with your email and password, then click "Register". If the data is valid, you'll receive a confirmation.

## üìç Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) that supports JavaScript.
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to modify or extend the form as needed.
